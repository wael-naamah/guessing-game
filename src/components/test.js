// Here is an example of how the above logic could be implemented using JavaScript and WebSockets:
// At the beginning of each round, generate a random multiplier value that increases over time based on the speed slider.

const startRound = () => {
  let multiplier = 1;
  setInterval(() => {
    multiplier += 0.1 * speedSlider.value;
    updateMultiplierValue(multiplier);
  }, 100);
};

// Each player starts with a certain amount of points. They can place any number of points on their prediction, which is a guess for the multiplier value at which the game will freeze.

const placeBet = () => {
  const betPoints = parseInt(betInput.value);
  const predictedMultiplier = parseFloat(predictedInput.value);
  socket.emit("placeBet", { betPoints, predictedMultiplier });
};

// After all players have placed their bets, wait for the game to freeze. The game freezes when the multiplier value reaches the predicted value of one of the players.

socket.on("freeze", (winner) => {
  if (winner === null) {
    alert("No one won this round");
  } else {
    alert(`Player ${winner.id} won this round with ${winner.points} points!`);
  }
  updatePoints();
  clearBets();
});

// Calculate the winner of the round. The winner is the player whose prediction matches the frozen multiplier value. They receive points equal to the points they placed multiplied by the multiplier value at which the game froze. All other players lose the points they placed.

const calculateWinner = () => {
  const bets = getAllBets();
  const frozenMultiplier = getFrozenMultiplier();
  let winner = null;
  bets.forEach((bet) => {
    if (bet.predictedMultiplier === frozenMultiplier) {
      const pointsWon = bet.betPoints * frozenMultiplier;
      winner = { id: bet.playerId, points: pointsWon };
      updatePlayerPoints(bet.playerId, pointsWon);
    } else {
      updatePlayerPoints(bet.playerId, -bet.betPoints);
    }
  });
  return winner;
};

// Repeat the above steps for a set number of rounds. After all rounds are complete, calculate the total points for each player.

const calculateTotalPoints = () => {
  const players = getAllPlayers();
  players.forEach((player) => {
    let totalPoints = 0;
    player.bets.forEach((bet) => {
      totalPoints += bet.points;
    });
    player.totalPoints = totalPoints;
  });
};

//Display the rankings of all players based on their total points.

const displayRankings = () => {
  const players = getAllPlayers();
  players.sort((a, b) => b.totalPoints - a.totalPoints);
  let rankingsHtml = "";
  players.forEach((player, index) => {
    rankingsHtml += `<tr><td>${index + 1}</td><td>${player.id}</td><td>${
      player.totalPoints
    }</td></tr>`;
  });
  rankingsTable.innerHTML = rankingsHtml;
};

//Allow players to send messages to each other through the chat box.

const sendMessage = () => {
  const message = messageInput.value;
  const playerName = getPlayerName();
  socket.emit("sendMessage", { playerName, message });
};
socket.on("receiveMessage", (data) => {
  const message = `${data.playerName}: ${data.message}`;
  chatBox.innerHTML += `<p>${message}</p>`;
});

//Generate 4 auto-players that make their own predictions and compete with the human players.

const generateAutoPlayers = () => {
  const playerNames = ["Auto 1", "Auto 2", "Auto 3", "Auto 4"];
  playerNames.forEach((name) => {
    const playerId = generatePlayerId();
    addPlayer(playerId, name, true);
    const predictedMultiplier = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) / 10;
    const betPoints = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);

//Note that the above implementation is just one possible way to implement the game logic using JavaScript and WebSockets. The actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements and design of the game.
